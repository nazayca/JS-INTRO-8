HOW TO DELETE LOCAL AND REMOTE Repositories 
Remote:
    1. Go to your remote repo
    2. Click on Settings
    3. Scroll all the way down and click on Delete this repository 
    4. Follow the steps 

Local: Just delete the folder/repo like you delete anything else in your machine/local 


HOW TO IGNORE SOME CHANGES IN SPECIFIC FILES that GIT DOES NOT TRACK?
-Create a file called as .gitignore in the local repo and list the file names to be ignored before you track them.


HOW TO ADD COLLABORATORS
1. Go to remote repo 
2. Click on Settings 
3. Click on COLLABORATORS 
4. Start adding COLLABORATORS

NOTE: We do not make our changes in the master/main branch 
Each team member have to create their own branch and need to make their changes there. 
Then, they will push their code to remote with their branch.
Finally, they will create a PULL/MERGE REQUEST to master.
