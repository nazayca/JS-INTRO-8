AJAX: 

setTimeOut() function is used for hard pause for the code. So, we will stay away from it. Instead, we will 
learn implicit wait which is used to wait until a condition happens or up to certain amount of time. 


Ways to handle asynchronous JavaScript code 
1. Callbacks 
2. Promises 
3. Async Await 

async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function
await keyword ise used to wait for an event till it completes, then it cotinues with the next event 
await keyword can ONLY BE USED with the functions that return a PROMISE.

80 minutes party
-go to costco -> 20 minutes
-get meats and veggies -> 15 minutes
-cook -> 30 minutes
-serve -> 10 minutes 
-eat -> 5 minutes 

1. Eat 
2. Serve 
3. Get meat and veggies
4. Go to costco
5. Cook


function goToCostco() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            if(carDoesNotBreak) resolve();
            else reject();
        }, 20000);
    });
}

function getMeat() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            if(meatAvailable) resolve();
            else reject();
        }, 15000);
    });
}

function cook() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            if(gasAvailable) resolve();
            else reject();
        }, 30000);
    });
}

function serve() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            if(noIssues) resolve();
            else reject();
        }, 10000);
    });
}

function eat() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            if(noProblem) resolve();
            else reject();
        }, 5000);
    });
}

//
async function test() {
    try {
        await goToCostco();
        await getMeat();
        await cook();
        await serve();
        await eat();
    } catch(err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
}

ERROR HANDLING 
Error: Unexpected result from a running program.

There are 2 types of errors 
1. Syntax error: this type of errors happen because of programmer like spelling errors. 
2. Runtime error: this type of errors may happen due to a logical mistake by programmer or a system issue.


try-catch-finally blocks 
-We will use try for a block of code that could possibly throw an error.
-catch block is used to catch if any error happens in the try block and customize the error.
-catch block will be executed ONLY IF there is an error. 
-try block cannot be used alone. It requires either catch or finally or both. 
-catch or finally blocks cannot be used without try block. 
-finally block is always executed in case of error or not.


throw keyword 
-this keyword is used to throw a custom error intentionally

function giveMeAPositiveNumber(number) {
    if(number > 0) console.log('Thanks!', number);
    else throw new Error('Bad guy!!! Give positive number!', 0);
}
