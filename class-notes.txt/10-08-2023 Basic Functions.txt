What is a function/method?
-These are components that could execute a task whenever used.
-They are reusable and could be used whenever needed.

Programming languaes provides us thousands of pre-built methods/functions to use in our applications/programs.
However, you may need more functions and you can create your custom functions in case the language does not provide it.


// Start the meeting
// Create a file
// Start coding

SYNTAX:
function name() {
    // reusable coding statements
}

name(); // invoking the function

How to execute the block of function?
-To be able to execute the block of function, you need to invoke/call the function with its name.
