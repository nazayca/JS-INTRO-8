ES6 Class GETTERS and SETTERS
Getters: are used to get properties of an object
Getters are mostly return type methods and usually they do not take argument unless necessary

Setters: are used to set properties of an object
Setters are mostly void type (not returning) and they mostly take arguments to be set as the new information

ADVANTAGES OF GETTERS AND SETTERS
-They provide programmer better control mechanism to access information and update information


Class: is a template-blueprint can be used to create many objects 
Objects: they are instances of their classes 

Class: Person
Object: Suzanne, Ayca, John

Object Properties
-if each object has different information for one property like name - this should be non-static -> Ayca, Suzanne, John
-if a behavior differs for objects like sound, walk, run -> this should be non-static -> Ayca, Suzanne, John
-Every object shares the same info -> static property - belongs to class -> we have 2 eyes
-Every object have a feature -> static function -> belongs to class -> breath

Static members belong to class and can only be accessed with the className
Syntax: Class.property or Class.function() 
-Static members cannot be accessed with the objects 

Non-static members belong to the objects and can only be accessed with the objects created 
Syntax: const obj = new Class();
        obj.property or obj.function()
-Non-static members cannot be accessed with the className
