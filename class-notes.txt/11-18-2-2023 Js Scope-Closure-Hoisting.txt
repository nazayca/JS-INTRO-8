11-18-2023 JS Scope - Closure - Hoisting - Currying
ES6 release happened in 2015. (ES2015)
-var is replaced with 2 new reserved keywords - let & const


var: used before ES6
let: is an ES6 feature and used for variables that you would like to reassign later
const: is an ES6 feature and used for constants meaning the value of the variable cannot be changed.

var-let-const
-var is hoisted, let and const are not hoisted.


let: mutable
const: immutable


Scope-Closure-Hoisting
-All are used and telling us information about the accessibility of the variables.
-{} -> this is known as a block and usually it holds a few lines of code
    Examples: if-else, loops, functions, switch


// Global Scope
var x = 10;
let y = 11;
const z = 12;


// Block Scope 
{
    var x = 10;
    let y = 11;
    const z = 12;
}


// Function Scope
function funcName() {
    var x = 10;
    let y = 11;
    const z = 12;    
}


// Lexical Scope - nested functions
-In case you have nested functions;
    The inner function can access the outer function variables 
    However, the outer function cannot access the inner function variables 
-Same rule applies to all var, let and const variables.


Hoisting: is a concept that JS moves variable declarations to the top of the file and allows you to access the 
variable reference but not the value.
Functions can also be hosited unless they are stored in a variable using function expression or arrow functions.

-var keyword can be hoisted but let and const cannot be hoisted.
-Functions that are created with regular syntax will be hoisted and can be used anywhere within the file with no issues.
However, function expressions and arrow functions are not hoisted and can only be used after they are created.
