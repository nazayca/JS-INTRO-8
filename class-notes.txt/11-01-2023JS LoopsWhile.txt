Loop: loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a termination point is reached.
It prevents code duplication and save tim-effort for programmers. 

5 types of loops 
1. for loop 
    for(start; condition; update) {
        // Code block to execute
    }

2. while loop
3. do-while loop 
4. for...of loop 
5. for...in loop 


Infinite loop: It is a loop that never reached the termination point. 

for( ; ; ) {
    // code
}

Iteration: Each cycle that loop executes. 



2. while loop 

Syntax:
while(condition) {
    // code block to be executed
}

for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}


let i = 1;

while(i <= 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}


Unreachable code: This is a piece code that will never execute and usually it is a mistake done by programmer.

3. do-while loop
-This is similar to while loop except it runs the code block first, then checks the condition.
-So, that is the reason your code block for do-while will execute at least once all the time. 

HOW TO DECIDE BETWEEN for vs while vs do-while loops?

            Do I know how many times the program will execute?
                YES                               NO
                for                         while or do-while 
                                ARE WE GOING TO EXECUTE IT AT LEAST ONCE?
                                    YES                     NO
                                  do-while                 while
