Computer: A computer is an electronic machine that is used to input, process, and then output data,
typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program.

Computer is consist of both hardware software:
Hardware: all the parts you can feel, touch.
input devices: mouse, keyboard
output devices: printer, screen
CPU, harddisk, RAM and more.

Software:
OS (linux, windows, macOS, android, IOS)
applications: gmail, google, amazon
Office suite, adobe-reader, games

Software is the soul while hardware is the body parts.

CPU: Central Processing Unit: the brain of the computer

Counting System:
Human way of counting is relying on base-10:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9     -> base-10 number system - Decimal System
10
100
1000
10000
100000
1000000

| | | | | | | | | | -> -> oldest way of number system

Binary code: ones and zeros which known as computer language
ONE: ON
ZERO: OFF

PEN -> 011010101101011010

byte: storage unit
bit: either zero or ones

1 byte =  8 bits
1024 bytes = k


HUMAN LANGUAGE      COMPUTER LANGUAGE
0                   00000000
1                   00000001
23                  00010111
45                  00101101


Computer converts everything to ones and zeros.
Letters?

HUMAN LANGUAGE      COMPUTER LANGUAGE
PEN                 01010000-01000101-01001110
Cat                 01000011-01100001-01110100
C = 67    01000011
a = 97    01100001
t = 116   01110100

Programing Language: Source code is any code that is written with programming languages
source code -> computer processes it and converts it to binary code (ones and zeros) -> ASCII -> human readable language
source code is simply known as the "code".
-Examples: JavaScript, Java, Go, Phyton, C#

DIFFERENCE BT Natural languages and Programing languages: Ambiquity - confusion or mistakes.
Natural languages have grammar rules while programming languages has syntax rules.

EXAMPLE:
Some sugar
1 lb of sugar

Natural languages: English, Spanish
instructions to computer
used for building applications
