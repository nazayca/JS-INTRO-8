-typeof operator for arrays returns object

How do you understand if a variable is an array?
-You can use Array.isArray() method to check if a variable is actually an array.
-If this method returns true, then the variable is array, otherwise it will return false stating the variable
is not an array.


12. Array.isArray() method 
-used to check if a variable is array.
-it takes an argument to be checked.
-it returns a boolean. It returns true if the variable is actually an array, false otherwise.
-it does not change anything with the original array.


13. sort() method 
-used to sort array elements
    -Strings: alphabetically from A-Z and a-z
    -Numbers: You may expect to sort from smaller to greater number but it still sorts alphabetically
-it does not take any argument when you are sorting strings but we can have some arguments to sort numbers as expected.
-it returns the original array back sorted.
-it modifies the original array and returns it.


SORTING NUMBERS with a comparison callback function!
callback function: is a function passed into another function as an argument.

const numbers = [ 1, 2, 5, 100, 21 ];

numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b); // sorting ascending - smaller to bigger
// numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a); // sorting descending - bigger to smaller

console.log(numbers); // [ 1, 2, 5, 21, 100 ]


14. flat() method
-reduces the dimension of nested arrays with their elements.
-if it is only one nested array, you don't need to but for more nested arrays, you may use dimension argument.
-it returns a new array which flattened.
-it does not change anything with the original array.


15. toString() method 
-used to convert an array to a string 
-does not take any argument
-it returns a string 
-it does not change anything with the original array.


16. join() method 
-used to convert an array to a string 
-does not take any argument if you want to get , default separator (coma). However, it allows us to
    give our own separator as a string argument. 
-it returns a string 
-it does not change anything with the original array.


ARRAY DESTRUCTIRING
-Destructuring allows us to extract values from arrays, objects, or other iterable data 
structures and assign them to variables in a more concise and readable way. 

iterable data = you can loop that data.
