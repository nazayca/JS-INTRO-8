-Array is a widely used data structure in any programming language. 
-Data Structure: general term used for storing data.

You need to know a few things about each method of the array, string, object or whenever you learn a
new method.
-methodName
-task that it runs
-does it take argument? If yes, how many or what type of arguments
-does it return anything? If yes, then what it returns


1. push() method
-add new elements to an existing array - to the end - tail
-it may take one or multiple elements as arguments
-it returns the new length of the array as a number 
-it changes the original array


2. pop() method
-removes the last element from an existing array - from the end - tail
-it does not take any argument
-it returns the removed element back
-it changes the original array


shift vs unshift
unshift -> add - makes array longer
shift -> remove - makes array shorter

3. unshift() method 
-add new elements to an existing array - to the beginning - head
-it may take one or multiple elements as arguments
-it returns the new length of the array as a number 
-it changes the original array


4. shift() method 
-removes the first element from an existing array - from the beginning - head
-it does not take any argument
-it returns the removed element back
-it changes the original array


5. includes() method 
-checks if an element exists in an array and returns boolean
-it takes one element as an argument
-it returns true if the element is present in the array, or false otherwise
-it does not change anything in the original array


6. indexOf() method
-checks if an element exists in the array and returns the first found occurrence's index.
-it takes one element as an argument
-it returns an index as a number (0 or positive if the element exist, -1 otherwise)
-it does not change anything in the original array


7. lastIndexOf() method
-checks if an element exists in the array and returns the last found occurrence's index.
-it takes one element as an argument
-it returns an index as a number (0 or positive if the element exist, -1 otherwise)
-it does not change anything in the original array


8. concat() method
-concatenates/combines two or more arrays together and creates a new array
-it takes an array as an argument
-it returns a new array
-it does not change anything in the original array

Spread Operator: The Spread (...) operator expands an iterable (like an array) into its individual 
elements.
NOTE: This could be useful when concatenating and pushing multiple elements into some other arrays.


9. reverse() method
-reverses the original array 
-it does not take any argument
-it returns the modified original array 
-it changes the original array
